We still have NO DATA showing in the backend UI.
This means the database is seeded but UI is not reading data OR tables don’t have the correct fields populated.

Please fix these items NOW so that the dashboard, drivers, vehicles, customers, and bookings all load properly.

✅ 1️⃣ Insert DEMO DATA into ALL Required Tables (MANDATORY)

Please insert the following minimum demo rows in each table so UI has something to load.

✔ customers table — insert 10 customers

Columns required:

id

name

phone

email

whatsapp (same as phone)

total_rides

lifetime_spend

preferred_car_type

notes

created_at

📌 Insert REALISTIC sample customers.

✔ drivers table — insert 8 drivers

Columns required:

id

driver_name

phone

email

license_number

license_expiry

vendor_id

status (online/offline)

created_at

📌 Drivers must be connected to valid vendors.

✔ vehicles table — insert 8 vehicles

USE THE ACTUAL SCHEMA:

id

vendor_id

type

plate_number

model

color

status (active/inactive)

created_at

📌 Make sure type and plate_number are correctly populated.

✔ vendors table — insert at least 2 vendors

Columns:

id

name

email

phone

address

created_at

✔ bookings table — THIS IS THE BLOCKER (FIX THIS FIRST)

USE ONLY the REAL columns your DB actually has.
Insert 15 demo bookings with:

id

customer_id (from customers table)

driver_id (from drivers table)

vehicle_id (from vehicles table)

vendor_id

pickup_location

dropoff_location

distance_km

fare

status (pending / completed / cancelled)

payment_method

pickup_time

dropoff_time

created_at

📌 IMPORTANT:
Every booking must reference existing customers, drivers, vehicles, vendors.

📌 THIS is the main reason UI is blank — bookings table not populated properly.

✅ 2️⃣ Make Sure API Endpoints Return Data

After demo data insertion, ensure:

/api/customers → returns customer list
/api/drivers → returns driver list
/api/vehicles → returns vehicles list
/api/bookings → returns bookings
/dashboard/stats → returns metrics

If any return empty → fix controllers.

✅ 3️⃣ Dashboard Must Show This Data (Non-Negotiable)

Dashboard cards MUST load:

Total Customers

Total Drivers

Total Vehicles

Total Bookings

Today’s Bookings

Yesterday’s Bookings

Weekly / Monthly bookings

Revenue

These should query actual demo data.

✅ 4️⃣ Until Data Loads — STOP all other tasks

No more vendor UI
No more RBAC
No more notifications
No more email/WhatsApp work

FIRST priority → data MUST appear in the backend.
